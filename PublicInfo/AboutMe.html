<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello there. My name is Danielle Kasper. I'm an aspriring programmer working towards becoming an expert in Front-End Development.
  I absolutely love criting thinking and solving puzzles, which makes programming such a fullfilling area of work.
  If you were to ask me what my hobbies include, you'd definitely hear me mention sudoku, puzzles and other mathematical/analytical activities. 
</p>

<p>Outside of programming, I have many other interests that keep my life exciting and meaningful. One of my favorite hobbies is scuba diving.
  Under the sea, there is a whole other world, and I get to experience that. The feeling of being weightless, surrounded by creatures you don't get to see on land,
  is truly out of this world. I also love movies! I'm the type that gets so invested in a film, that I feel all the emotions of each character, and you will 
  often see my crying, smiling, laughing, or even fearful. It's another way that I get to experience other worlds. When I'm not scuba diving or at the cinema,
  you can usually find me playing video games, hanging around the beach, or at a restaurant (I'm a huge foodie).
</p>

<p>I hope this gave you a little insight of who Danielle is. If you wish to know more, please refer to the <a href="./ContactInfo.html">Contact Page</a> where you will find details 
  on how to get in contact with me.
